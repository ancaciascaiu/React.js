# Welcome to 20spokes Code Challenge!

The challenge is to create a contact form using React to post to the Rails server and save the contact information.

## Getting Started

* Go to app/assets/javascripts/components/contact.js.jsx which has been setup to include the form. It is being rendered in app/views/contact/index.html.haml.
* Create form in contact.js.jsx with a post to the contact controller in Rails
* Create a model called Contact with the following attributes: first name, last name, email, and message.

## Notes

* Bootstrap has been included to assist with design.
* Extra Credit for validating form inputs which are all required.
